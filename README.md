## Adapted from the 2019 Advent of Code

This interview is a slightly adapted version of the [2019 Advent of Code event](https://adventofcode.com/2019/). It focuses on the Intcode computer iterations and uses a specific memory/expected values set.

Several portions of the Advent of Code design are skipped (including the fluff around it being Christmas and rocket-ship themed), leaving behind mostly the crunchy implementation details.

This is intended to be an interview based around pairing, Test-Driven Development, collaboration, and a complex problem with requirements that are not immediately understood. A large number of examples are provided that you can use to write your tests, but it is up to you and your pair on how you want to actually implement the details of the computer.

Good luck!
