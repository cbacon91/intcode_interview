## Adapted from the 2019 Advent of Code

This interview is a slightly adapted version of the [2019 Advent of Code event](https://adventofcode.com/2019/). It focuses on the Intcode computer iterations and uses a specific memory/expected values set.

Several portions of the Advent of Code design are skipped (as well as the fluff and lore around it being Christmas and rocket-ship themed), leaving behind mostly the crunchy implementation details.

This is intended to be an interview based around pairing, Test-Driven Development, collaboration, and a complex problem with requirements that are not immediately understood. A large number of examples are provided, but it is up to you and your pair on how you want to actually implement the details of the computer.

Your pair will lead you through the exercise. Although the project has some initial scaffolding in terms of directory and file structure, feel free to modify it as you see fit, as long as the requirements are ultimately met.

Good luck!
