### Part Five: Refactoring and Optimization
###### Adapted from Advent of Code 2019, day nine, part two.

At this point, your Intcode computer is complete and functioning. There is one last test.

With the same initial memory as in part four, use `2` as your input instead of `1`. This will take longer to run. While keeping the existing tests all green and functional, clean up any leftover code cruft and optimize what remains such that this function runs quickly.

Keep in mind SOLID principles, clean code, and something that is easy to maintain should the need arise and something you're proud of!
